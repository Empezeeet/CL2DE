# Command Line 2D Engine (CLYDE)

This is joke. but it works

You can create simple shapes with this graphic engine.

Currently writing C++11 Version for better efficiency.

# How to use?
###### Don't
Use clyde_renderer.py or renderer.h like this:
    
        import clyde_renderer
            or 
        #include "renderer.h"




# Use cases
Python version is better for rendering smaller objects and/or when FPS are not so important
For example in Discord Bot's games

C++ is better when FPS are important.
For example in CommandLine games




test.* files are used to test rendering engine. You don't need them
***You can use them as examples***
